Problem Definition:

There are two separate datasets: individual and household. Household dataset contains various information about a household, such as number of rooms and bedrooms, material of floor, walls and roof, annual expenditure of the household for different categories and whether it is in rural or in urban. Individual dataset contains information about the individuals in the household dataset. 

The aim of the project is to create an end-to-end pipeline that extracts, transforms and loads the data, performs exploratory analysis on it and build a classification model that predicts whether the household is located in rural or in urban. In order to improve the model’s performance, household data will be expanded with the decisive features from the individual dataset.
